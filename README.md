This application takes in user inputs and saves them in a mysql database, and displays saved notes on the left. Mobile-responsive.

## Motivation

This project was undertaken to practice skills with express, mysql, and heroku launching all working together.

## Tech used

Built with: HTML, Javascript, jQuery, mysql, express, and path.

## Features

This is a fairly basic note logging application. A user can title their note, and add a body with it, then click submit to add it to the database. All of the notes currently logged in the database are displayed in the column on the left. When a note is submitted to the database it should appear in the left-hand column where all of the other notes appear without refreshing the page. By clicking on a trash can icon, the corresponding note will be deleted from the dtabase, and removed from the page, again without the need to refresh the page.
